Build Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clintam/surf.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/clintam/surf#)


A simple react/mongo stack managed with docker and make.

Goals:
* Modern and simple
* Quick dev cycles
* Isomorphic codebase runs in server and clients
* Supports effecient CI/CD practices

#### Quickstart

* Install Docker
* Build, test, bring up dev environment `make images all`
* Live reload of client/server
* Debug by attaching debugger to 5858.

OR 

* Install Nodejs
* Build with `npm install`
* Run with `npm run dev`

#### Make + Docker 

Simple make files where all the complex deps are managed by docker/docker-compose abstractions.
 
TODO: why is this a win?


#### React

* prefer functional components
